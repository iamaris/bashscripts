Computing limit starting from observation
Will compute expected limit(s) using minimizer Minuit2 with strategy 0 and tolerance 0.01
WARNING: Best fit of asimov dataset is at r = 0.044573 (0.002229 times rMax), while it should be at zero
Median for expected limits: 15.0625
Sigma  for expected limits: 7.68509
