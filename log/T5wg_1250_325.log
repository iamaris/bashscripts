Computing limit starting from observation
Will compute expected limit(s) using minimizer Minuit2 with strategy 0 and tolerance 0.01
WARNING: Best fit of asimov dataset is at r = 0.020726 (0.001036 times rMax), while it should be at zero
Median for expected limits: 9.28125
Sigma  for expected limits: 4.73542
